# Github Pages

You cannot directly use this theme with github pages. You need an external job to build the content with `build.sh` and the [.nojekyll](https://github.blog/2009-12-29-bypassing-jekyll-on-github-pages/) tab to instruct github to not build it by itself. 

The reason it doesn't work without a build job is the custom plugin (codetabs).
